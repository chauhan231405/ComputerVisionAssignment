Dear TensorGo,

I am submitting my assignment, which includes the code for converting SD videos to HD using an EDSR model. The output video meets the aspect ratio requirement of converting from 4:3 to 16:9 without stretching the original content. However, the video appears blurry due to limitations in the computational resources.

In the attached report, I have detailed the steps taken, challenges faced, and potential improvements. With more time and resources, I would focus on increasing the training epochs, using higher resolution inputs, and experimenting with different model architectures to improve the video quality.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to any feedback you might have.

Best regards,
Karan Chauhan
